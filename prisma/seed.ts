It retrieves live pages and sources first, then generates an answer grounded in what it found. That single fact explains almost everything else in this program: a page that cannot be fetched, parsed, or trusted cannot be retrieved, no matter how good it is. Ranking well in a search index and being retrieved and named by an assistant are related but genuinely separate problems, and the gap between them is where this whole discipline lives." },
  { code: "D2", order: 2, title: "Retrieval mechanics", summary: "Why ranking and being recommended are different problems.", bodyMd: "The overlap between a top-ten Google ranking and an actual AI citation has been falling, and depending on the study it sits somewhere between roughly one in six and one in two. That is not a rounding error, it is a structural shift: an assistant only cites what it can retrieve cleanly, parse confidently, and trust enough to attribute. A company, or a person, can be strong on every traditional signal and still be functionally invisible to every assistant a buyer actually asks." },
  { code: "D3", order: 3, title: "Entities and sameAs", summary: "Why a name collision costs you everything.", bodyMd: "To a machine, you are not a name, you are an entity: a bundle of facts that either resolve consistently across the web or do not. sameAs is the schema.org property that tells a crawler \"these five URLs are the same person.\" Without it, and without a consistent name and bio across every profile, a search engine or an assistant has to guess whether your GitHub and your LinkedIn are even the same human. A name collision with a bigger, unrelated entity is worse: you are not merely ambiguous, you are quietly outranked by someone else's footprint every time your name comes up." },
  { code: "D4", order: 4, title: "Extractable content", summary: "BLUF, question headings, atomic sections.", bodyMd: "Write for extraction, not just for reading. BLUF, bottom line up front, means the answer comes before the wind-up, because a model pulling a quotable claim out of your page will grab the first clear sentence it finds. Headings shaped as the actual questions a reader has beat clever section titles, because a model matches a query to a heading far more literally than a human would. And every section should stand on its own: if a paragraph only makes sense with three paragraphs of context above it, it is much harder for anything to lift and quote cleanly." },
  { code: "D5", order: 5, title: "The measurement standard", summary: "n>=5, rates not positions, two geographies.", bodyMd: "One screenshot of one answer proves nothing, because these systems are not deterministic: ask the same question five times and you can get five different answers. The house standard is n>=5 runs per prompt, across at least two geographies where that is possible, reported as a rate, not a position. \"We rank #1 in ChatGPT\" is not just bad practice, it is often not even a coherent claim, because there is no fixed rank to hold. What you can honestly say is \"named in 4 of 5 runs.\" That sentence is defensible in a way a screenshot never is." },
  { code: "D6", order: 6, title: "Claims discipline", summary: "Banned phrasings, A/B/C source grading, never guarantee.", bodyMd: "Never guarantee AI placement, to anyone, ever, because nobody controls a retrieval system closely enough to promise an outcome inside it. Grade every number by its source: A is your own n>=5 measurement, B is two or more independent sources, C is a single source, and a Grade C stat only ever gets quoted with its attribution and its caveat attached, never bare. This is not caution for its own sake. It is the difference between a claim that survives a skeptical question and one that does not, and in a business built on measurement integrity, that difference is the entire product." },
